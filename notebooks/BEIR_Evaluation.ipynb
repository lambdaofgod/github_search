No need to download or install anything!\\n\\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Vu9HqbIKqXWlr0IH1z3oCq3K3dHE1t4H\\n\\n---\\n:new:\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use our `shapeshifter2d.py` and `shapeshifter3d.py` scripts to generate shapeshifter-style perturbations. We currently have examples for various shapeshifter-style perturbations in the `Makefile`:\\n```\\n$ make\\n\\nUsage:\\n  make <target>\\n  help                                  Display this help\\n\\nDependencies\\n  deps                                  Install dependencies, compile protobufs, and patch projects.\\n\\nHelpers\\n  tensorboard                           Launch tensorboard to monitor progress.\\n\\nAttacks\\n  2d_stopsign_targeted_attack           Create 2d stop sign that is detected as a person.\\n  2d_stopsign_untargeted_attack         Create 2d stop sign that is not detected as a stop sign.\\n  2d_stopsign_proposal_attack           Create 2d stop sign that is not detected.\\n  2d_stopsign_hybrid_targeted_attack    Create 2d stop sign that is either not detected at all or detected as a person.\\n  2d_stopsign_hybrid_untargeted_attack  Create 2d stop sign that is either not detected at all or not detected as a stop sign.\\n  2d_person_proposal_attack             Create 2d tshirt that is not detected.\\n  2d_person_targeted_attack             Create 2d tshirt that is detected as a bird.\\n  2d_person_untargeted                  Create 2d tshirt that is not detected as a person.\\n  2d_person_hybrid_untargeted           Create 2d tshirt that is either not detected at all or not detected as a person.\\n  2d_person_hybrid_targeted             Create 2d tshirt that is either not detected or is detected as a bird.\\n  3d_person_targeted_attack             Create 3d outfit that is detected as a bird.\\n  3d_person_untargeted_attack           Create 3d outfit that is not detected as a person.\\n  3d_person_proposal_attack             Create 3d outfit that is not detected.\\n  3d_person_hybrid_targeted_attack      Create 3d outfit that is either not detected at all or detected as a bird.\\n  3d_person_hybrid_untargeted_attack    Create 3d outfit that is either not detected at all or not detected as a person.\\n```\\n\\nFor these to work, you will have to first install our dependencies and patches via:\\n```\\nmake deps\\n```\\nThis will create a Python 3.6 virtual environment, install dependencies via [Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) (we assume Pipenv is already installed), compile protobufs in the [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), and apply our patches to the [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) and [Lucid](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid) dependencies.\\n\\nYou can watch the progress of the perturbation generation via:\\n```\\nmake tensorboard\\n```\\nNavigate your browser to the printed url to see the Tensorboard output.\\n\\nYou can also see example outputs from these scripts in the pictures section below.\\n\\nWe have also released our 3D ShapeShifter pedestrian models that we showcased in our [recent talk at DSML'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12622).

The ith column represents the 300-dimensional word vectors of the class name of the ith row of `vocabulary_list.txt`\\n\\n## Running instructions\\n* **Running Demo Code:** To run generalized zero-shot detection on sample input kept in `Dataset/Sampleinput`, simply run `gzsd.py` after installing all dependencies like Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV or alternatively use the `.yaml` file (see above under `Requirements`) to create a new environment with all dependencies. Place the pre-trained model available from ([Link to pre-trained model for demo (h5 format)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/97gfrngizymricd/resnet50_polar_loss.h5?dl=0)) in the `Model` directory. This code will generate the output files for each input image to `Dataset/Sampleoutput`.\\n* **Running Train/Test Code on MSCOCO:** Extract the dataset `train2014.zip` and `val2014.zip` inside the folder Dataset. These files are downloadable from [Link](http://cocodataset.org/#download). Make sure the pre-trained model is present inside the Model folder (\\'Model/resnet50_csv_50_focal_seen_w2v.h5\\'). This pre-trained model is trained by focal loss on 65 seen classes without considering any vocabulary metric. This model is available to download from ([Link to pre-trained model for training (h5 format)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dc0vit1dj83rd56/resnet50_csv_50_focal_seen_w2v.h5?dl=0)). Also, make sure the `snapshots` folder is already created to store intermediate models of each epoch. Then, run the following commands for training and testing.\\n- Training: `python keras_retinanet/bin/train_vocab_w2v.py --snapshot-path ./snapshots csv MSCOCO/train_coco_seen_all.csv MSCOCO/cls_names_seen_coco.csv`\\n- Testing GZSD: \\n`python keras_retinanet/bin/evaluate.py csv MSCOCO/validation_coco_unseen_seen_all_gzsd.csv MSCOCO/cls_names_test_coco.csv snapshots/resnet50_csv_30.h5` \\n\\n## Notes on MSCOCO experiments\\nThe resources required to reproduce results are kept in the directory `MSCOCO`. For training and testing, we used MSCOCO-2014 train images from `train2014.zip` and validation images from `val2014.zip`. These zipped archives are downloadable from MSCOCO website ([Link](http://cocodataset.org/#download)). Please find the exact list of images (with annotations) used for \"training\" in `MSCOCO/train_coco_seen_all.csv`. The lists of images used for \"testing\" different ZSL settings are:\\n* For traditional detection task: `MSCOCO/validation_coco_seen_all.csv`, \\n* For zero-shot detection task: `MSCOCO/validation_coco_unseen_all.csv`, and \\n* For generalized zero-shot detection task: `MSCOCO/validation_coco_unseen_seen_all_gzsd.csv`.\\n\\n![ResultsSnapshot](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/images/Fig3_PL-ZSD.JPG) \\n![Qualitative Results](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/images/Fig5_PL-ZSD.JPG) \\n*The above results are for Generalized Zero-shot detection setting. The seen/unseen objects are enclosed in yellow/red bounding boxes.*\\n\\n## Notes on Pascal VOC experiment\\nThe number of images used to evaluate seen classes is not mentioned in the paper. We have used 4836 images from test+val set of 2007, where no unseen image appeared. Thus, the seen performances are the traditional detection performance of the final model. It is not generalized ZSD. To get exact images used for seen detection, please find `VOC/testval_voc07_seen.csv` at the following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sy1mwbaquxobv8i/VOC.zip?dl=0).\\n\\n## Tests in the wild\\nWe run the PL-ZSD model on two example videos from the [Youtube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/) dataset from Google AI. The demo videos contain several seen (e.g., pottend plant, person, hand-bag) and unseen classes (cat, train, suitcase). Note that we do not apply any pre/post processing procedure across temporal domain to smooth out the predictions. \\n\\n<!-- [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Qi5HfHatVXE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi5HfHatVXE \"Demo Video (Cats)\") \\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UJFUqjEd3Rw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJFUqjEd3Rw \"Demo Video (Train station)\") \\n![Cat Gif](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/images/cat_demo.gif)\\n![Train Gif](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/images/train_demo.gif)\\n-->\\n\\n| [Link to Video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi5HfHatVXE) | [Link to Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJFUqjEd3Rw) |\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n<img src=\"https://salman-h-khan.github.io/images/cat_demo.gif\" width=\"400\" /> | <img src=\"https://salman-h-khan.github.io/images/train_demo.gif\" width=\"400\" />\\n\\n*The above results are for Generalized Zero-shot detection setting.

REPP links detections accross frames by evaluating their similarity and refines their classification and location to suppress false positives and recover misdetections.\\n\\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./figures/pipeline.png\" alt=\"Post-processing pipeline\" width=\"450\"/></p>\\n\\nREPP improves video detections both for specific Image and Video Object Detectors and it supposes a light computation overhead.\\n\\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./figures/results_table.png\" alt=\"Results\" width=\"1000\"/></p>\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nREPP has been tested with Python 3.6.\\n\\nIts dependencies can be found in _repp_requirements.txt_ file.\\n\\n```pip install -r repp_requirements.txt```\\n\\n\\n## Quick usage guide\\n\\nVideo detections must be stored with pickle as tuples (video_name, {frame_dets}) as following:\\n\\n```\\n(\"video_name\", {\"000001\": [ det_1, det_2, ..., det_N ],\\n                \"000002\": [ det_1, det_2, ..., det_M ]},\\n                ...)\\n```\\n\\nIf the stored predictions file contains detections for different videos, they must be saved as a stream of tuples with the above format.\\n\\nAnd each detection must have the following format:\\n\\n```\\ndet_1: {\\'image_id\\': image_id,     # Same as the used in ILSVRC if applies\\n        \\'bbox\\': [ x_min, y_min, width, height ],\\n        \\'scores\\': scores,         # Vector of class confidence scores\\n        \\'bbox_center\\': (x,y) }    # Relative bounding box center\\n```\\n\\n_bbox_center_ coordinates are bounded by 0 and 1 and referes to the center of the detection when the image has been padded vertically or horizontally to fit a square shape. \\n\\nCheck [this code](https://github.com/AlbertoSabater/Robust-and-efficient-post-processing-for-video-object-detection/blob/master/demos/YOLOv3/get_repp_predictions.py) for a better insight about the predictions format.\\n\\nPost-processed detections can be saved both with the COCO or IMDB format.\\n\\n\\n```\\npython REPP.py --repp_cfg ./REPP_cfg/cfg.json --predictions_file predictions_file.pckl --store_coco --store_imdb\\n```\\n\\nAs a REPP configuration file, you can use either _fgfa_repp_cfg.json_ or _yolo_repp_cfg.json_. The first one works better with high performing detectors such as SELSA or FGFA and the second one works better for lower quality detectors. We recommend to set _appearance_matching_ to false in the config file since it requires a non-trivial training of extra models and it\\'s not mandatory for the performance bossting. If needed, the following config parameters can be tunned:\\n\\n* _min_tubelet_score_ and _min_pred_score_: threshold used to suppress low-scoring detections. Higher values speeds up the post-processing execution.\\n* _clf_thr_: threshold to suppress low-scoring detections linking. Lower values will lead to more False Positives and higher ones will lead to fewer detections.\\n* _recoordinate_std_: higher values lead to a more aggressive recoordinating, lower values to a smoother one.\\n\\nBelow you will find instructions to perform any video predictions with YOLOv3 and apply REPP.\\n\\n\\n## Demos\\n\\nIn order to reproduce the results of the paper, you can download the predictions of the different models from the following [link](https://unizares-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/asabater_unizar_es/EdtTvM9EklBCsAeLIhwZSvIB4XZQPLTo3h4QU2QFKpb92w?e=dNGY6I) and locate them in the project folder as structured in the downloaded zip folder. \\n\\nImagenet VID dataset must be downloaded and stored with the following folder structure:\\n```\\n/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/\\n/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/Annotations/DET\\n/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/Annotations/VID\\n/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/Data/DET\\n/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/Data/VID\\n/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/ImageSets\\n```\\n\\nFollowing commands will apply the REPP post-processing and will evaluate the results by calculating the mean Average Precision for different object motions:\\n\\n```\\n# YOLO\\npython REPP.py --repp_cfg ./REPP_cfg/yolo_repp_cfg.json --predictions_file \\'./demos/YOLOv3/predictions/base_preds.pckl\\' --evaluate --annotations_filename ./data_annotations/annotations_val_ILSVRC.txt  --path_dataset /path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/ --store_coco --store_imdb\\n> {\\'mAP_total\\': 0.7506216640807263, \\'mAP_slow\\': 0.825347229618856, \\'mAP_medium\\': 0.742908326433008, \\'mAP_fast\\': 0.5657881762511975}\\n\\n# FGFA\\npython REPP.py --repp_cfg ./REPP_cfg/fgfa_repp_cfg.json --predictions_file \\'./demos/Flow-Guided-Feature-Aggregation/predictions/base_preds.pckl\\' --evaluate --annotations_filename ./data_annotations/annotations_val_ILSVRC.txt --path_dataset /path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/ --store_coco --store_imdb\\n> {\\'mAP_total\\': 0.8009014265948871, \\'mAP_slow\\': 0.8741923949671497, \\'mAP_medium\\': 0.7909183123072739, \\'mAP_fast\\': 0.6137783055850773}\\n\\n# SELSA\\npython REPP.py --repp_cfg ./REPP_cfg/selsa_repp_cfg.json --predictions_file \\'./demos/Sequence-Level-Semantics-Aggregation/predictions/old_preds.pckl\\' --evaluate --annotations_filename ./data_annotations/annotations_val_ILSVRC.txt --path_dataset /path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/ --store_coco --store_imdb\\n> {\\'mAP_total\\': 0.8421329795837483, \\'mAP_slow\\': 0.8871784038276325, \\'mAP_medium\\': 0.8332090469178383, \\'mAP_fast\\': 0.7109387713303483}\\n```\\n\\nInstead of download the base predictions, you can also compute them. To do so, you must __install the proper dependencies__ for each model as specified in the original model repositories ([YOLOv3](https://github.com/AlbertoSabater/Robust-and-efficient-post-processing-for-video-object-detection/tree/master/demos/YOLOv3), [FGFA](https://github.com/guanfuchen/Flow-Guided-Feature-Aggregation), [SELSA](https://github.com/happywu/Sequence-Level-Semantics-Aggregation)). You must also download their weights and config files from the following [link](https://unizares-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/asabater_unizar_es/Ecbuh0leCgdPg0Skl0LYoAYBgAURhldr-6Ng5cgSxBGYvA?e=Ufvn3Q) and locate them in the project folder as structured in the downloaded zip file. Then execute the following commands:\\n\\n```\\n# YOLO\\ncd demos/YOLOv3/\\npython get_repp_predictions.py --yolo_path ./pretrained_models/ILSVRC/1203_1758_model_8/ --repp_format --add_appearance --from_annotations ../../data_annotations/annotations_val_ILSVRC.txt --dataset_path /path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/Data/VID/\\n\\n# FGFA\\ncd demos/Flow-Guided-Feature-Aggregation/fgfa_rfcn/\\npython get_repp_predictions.py  --det_path \\'path_to_dataset/ILSVRC2015/\\'\\n# SELSA\\n\\ncd demos/Sequence-Level-Semantics-Aggregation/\\npython experiments/selsa/get_repp_predictions.py --dataset_path \\'path_to_dataset/ILSVRC2015/\\'\\n```\\n\\n\\n## REPP applied to custom videos\\n\\nREPP can be also applied to the predictions from any video as long as they have the specified REPP format. Following code shows how to compute YOLO predictions from any video and apply REPP post-processing.\\n```\\n# Extract YOLOv3 predictions\\ncd demos/YOLOv3/\\npython get_repp_predictions.py --yolo_path ./pretrained_models/ILSVRC/1203_1758_model_8/ --repp_format --add_appearance --from_video ./test_images/video_1.mp4\\n\\n# Apply REPP\\ncd ../..\\npython REPP.py --repp_cfg ./REPP_cfg/yolo_repp_cfg.json --predictions_file \\'./demos/YOLOv3/predictions/preds_repp_app_video_1.pckl\\' --store_coco\\n```\\n\\n\\n## REPP matching model training on ILSVRC\\n\\nThe present project includes trained linking models both to perform the detection matching with and without appearance descriptors. These models have been trained with data from Imagenet VID, but they are able to improve detections for any other dataset or custom video. These Logistic Regression models have been trained using the following steps, that can be adapted to any other custom dataset:\\n\\n1. Generate annotations for the Logistic Regression training, based on triplet tuplets (Anchor, Positive, Negative):\\n```\\npython create_triplet_ilsvrc_annotations.py --path_dataset \\'/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/\\'\\n```\\n2. Generate matching features from the annotations:\\n```\\npython clf_dataset_generation.py --path_dataset \\'/path/to/dataset/ILSVRC2015/\\' --add_appearance\\n```\\n3. Train and store the Logistic Regression model:\\n```\\npython train_clf_model.py --add_appearance\\n```\\n\\nPrevious steps include appearance features calculated from a pretrained YOLOv3 model. If you are going to use a different dataset or detection model, it\\'s recommended to omit the _--add_appearance_ parameter.\\n\\n\\n## Citation\\n```\\n@inproceedings{sabater2020repp,\\n  title={Robust and efficient post-processing for Video Object Detection},\\n  author={Alberto Sabater, Luis Montesano, Ana C.

Any questions or discussions are welcomed! \\n\\n## Abstract \\n\\nDetection identifies objects as axis-aligned boxes in an image. Most successful object detectors enumerate a nearly exhaustive list of potential object locations and classify each. This is wasteful, inefficient, and requires additional post-processing. In this paper, we take a different approach. We model an object as a single point -- the center point of its bounding box. Our detector uses keypoint estimation to find center points and regresses to all other object properties, such as size, 3D location, orientation, and even pose. Our center point based approach, CenterNet, is end-to-end differentiable, simpler, faster, and more accurate than corresponding bounding box based detectors. CenterNet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off on the MS COCO dataset, with 28.1% AP at 142 FPS, 37.4% AP at 52 FPS, and 45.1% AP with multi-scale testing at 1.4 FPS. We use the same approach to estimate 3D bounding box in the KITTI benchmark and human pose on the COCO keypoint dataset. Our method performs competitively with sophisticated multi-stage methods and runs in real-time.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Simple:** One-sentence method summary: use keypoint detection technic to detect the bounding box center point and regress to all other object properties like bounding box size, 3d information, and pose.\\n\\n- **Versatile:** The same framework works for object detection, 3d bounding box estimation, and multi-person pose estimation with minor modification.\\n\\n- **Fast:** The whole process in a single network feedforward. No NMS post processing is needed. Our DLA-34 model runs at *52* FPS with *37.4* COCO AP.\\n\\n- **Strong**: Our best single model achieves *45.1*AP on COCO test-dev.\\n\\n- **Easy to use:** We provide user friendly testing API and webcam demos.\\n\\n## Main results\\n\\n### Object Detection on COCO validation\\n\\n| Backbone     |  AP / FPS | Flip AP / FPS|  Multi-scale AP / FPS |\\n|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|\\n|Hourglass-104 | 40.3 / 14 | 42.2 / 7.8   | 45.1 / 1.4            |\\n|DLA-34        | 37.4 / 52 | 39.2 / 28    | 41.7 / 4              |\\n|ResNet-101    | 34.6 / 45 | 36.2 / 25    | 39.3 / 4              |\\n|ResNet-18     | 28.1 / 142| 30.0 / 71    | 33.2 / 12             |\\n\\n### Keypoint detection on COCO validation\\n\\n| Backbone     |  AP       |  FPS         |\\n|--------------|-----------|--------------|\\n|Hourglass-104 | 64.0      |    6.6       |\\n|DLA-34        | 58.9      |    23        |\\n\\n### 3D bounding box detection on KITTI validation\\n\\n|Backbone|FPS|AP-E|AP-M|AP-H|AOS-E|AOS-M|AOS-H|BEV-E|BEV-M|BEV-H| \\n|--------|---|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\\n|DLA-34  |32 |96.9|87.8|79.2|93.9 |84.3 |75.7 |34.0 |30.5 |26.8 |\\n\\n\\nAll models and details are available in our [Model zoo](readme/MODEL_ZOO.md).\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nPlease refer to [INSTALL.md](readme/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.\\n\\n## Use CenterNet\\n\\nWe support demo for image/ image folder, video, and webcam. \\n\\nFirst, download the models (By default, [ctdet_coco_dla_2x](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pl_-ael8wERdUREEnaIfqOV_VF2bEVRT) for detection and \\n[multi_pose_dla_3x](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PO1Ax_GDtjiemEmDVD7oPWwqQkUu28PI) for human pose estimation) \\nfrom the [Model zoo](readme/MODEL_ZOO.md) and put them in `CenterNet_ROOT/models/`.\\n\\nFor object detection on images/ video, run:\\n\\n~~~\\npython demo.py ctdet --demo /path/to/image/or/folder/or/video --load_model ../models/ctdet_coco_dla_2x.pth\\n~~~\\nWe provide example images in `CenterNet_ROOT/images/` (from [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/tree/master/demo)).

Or you can try to run so `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib test.mp4` How to use this SO-library from your own code - you can look at C++ example: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/src/yolo_console_dll.cpp\\n    or use in such a way: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib data/coco.names cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights test.mp4`\\n\\nTo run Darknet on Linux use examples from this article, just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`, i.e. use this command: `./darknet detector test ./cfg/coco.data ./cfg/yolov3.cfg ./yolov3.weights`\\n\\n### How to compile on Windows:\\n\\n1. If you have **MSVS 2015, CUDA 10.0, cuDNN 7.4 and OpenCV 3.x** (with paths: `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include` & `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`), then start MSVS, open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet.sln`, set **x64** and **Release** https://hsto.org/webt/uh/fk/-e/uhfk-eb0q-hwd9hsxhrikbokd6u.jpeg and do the: Build -> Build darknet. Also add Windows system variable `cudnn` with path to CUDNN: https://hsto.org/files/a49/3dc/fc4/a493dcfc4bd34a1295fd15e0e2e01f26.jpg **NOTE:** If installing OpenCV, use OpenCV 3.4.0 or earlier. This is a bug in OpenCV 3.4.1 in the C API (see [#500](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/issues/500)).\\n\\n    1.1. Find files `opencv_world320.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg320_64.dll` (or `opencv_world340.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg340_64.dll`) in `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\bin` and put it near with `darknet.exe`\\n    \\n    1.2 Check that there are `bin` and `include` folders in the `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\\\CUDA\\\\v9.1` if aren\\'t, then copy them to this folder from the path where is CUDA installed\\n    \\n    1.3. To install CUDNN (speedup neural network), do the following:\\n      \\n    * download and install **cuDNN v7.4.1 for CUDA 10.0**: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn\\n      \\n    * add Windows system variable `cudnn` with path to CUDNN: https://hsto.org/files/a49/3dc/fc4/a493dcfc4bd34a1295fd15e0e2e01f26.jpg\\n    \\n    1.4. If you want to build **without CUDNN** then: open `\\\\darknet.sln` -> (right click on project) -> properties  -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions, and remove this: `CUDNN;`\\n\\n2. If you have other version of **CUDA (not 10.0)** then open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet.vcxproj` by using Notepad, find 2 places with \"CUDA 10.0\" and change it to your CUDA-version, then do step 1\\n\\n3.

Download and install Python for Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-amd64.exe\\n\\n4. Run command: `python build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc\\\\voc_label.py` (to generate files: 2007_test.txt, 2007_train.txt, 2007_val.txt, 2012_train.txt, 2012_val.txt)\\n\\n5. Run command: `type 2007_train.txt 2007_val.txt 2012_*.txt > train.txt`\\n\\n6. Set `batch=64` and `subdivisions=8` in the file `yolov3-voc.cfg`: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/ee38c6e1513fb089b35be4ffa692afd9b3f65747/cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg#L3-L4)\\n\\n7.

Train it first on 1 GPU for like 1000 iterations: `darknet.exe detector train data/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg darknet53.conv.74`\\n\\n2. Then stop and by using partially-trained model `/backup/yolov3-voc_1000.weights` run training with multigpu (up to 4 GPUs): `darknet.exe detector train data/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg /backup/yolov3-voc_1000.weights -gpus 0,1,2,3`\\n\\nOnly for small datasets sometimes better to decrease learning rate, for 4 GPUs set `learning_rate = 0.00025` (i.e. learning_rate = 0.001 / GPUs). In this case also increase 4x times `burn_in =` and `max_batches =` in your cfg-file. I.e. use `burn_in = 4000` instead of `1000`.\\n\\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/darknet/NbJqonJBTSY/Te5PfIpuCAAJ\\n\\n## How to train (to detect your custom objects):\\n(to train old Yolo v2 `yolov2-voc.cfg`, `yolov2-tiny-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.2.0.cfg`, ...

Create file `yolo-obj.cfg` with the same content as in `yolov3.cfg` (or copy `yolov3.cfg` to `yolo-obj.cfg)` and:\\n\\n  * change line batch to [`batch=64`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L3)\\n  * change line subdivisions to [`subdivisions=8`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n  * change line `classes=80` to your number of objects in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers:\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L610\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L696\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L783\\n  * change [`filters=255`] to filters=(classes + 5)x3 in the 3 `[convolutional]` before each `[yolo]` layer\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L603\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L689\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L776\\n\\n  So if `classes=1` then should be `filters=18`. If `classes=2` then write `filters=21`.\\n  \\n  **(Do not write in the cfg-file: filters=(classes + 5)x3)**\\n  \\n  (Generally `filters` depends on the `classes`, `coords` and number of `mask`s, i.e. filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*<number of mask>`, where `mask` is indices of anchors. If `mask` is absence, then filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*num`)\\n\\n  So for example, for 2 objects, your file `yolo-obj.cfg` should differ from `yolov3.cfg` in such lines in each of **3** [yolo]-layers:\\n\\n  ```\\n  [convolutional]\\n  filters=21\\n\\n  [region]\\n  classes=2\\n  ```\\n\\n2. Create file `obj.names` in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, with objects names - each in new line\\n\\n3. Create file `obj.data` in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, containing (where **classes = number of objects**):\\n\\n  ```\\n  classes= 2\\n  train  = data/train.txt\\n  valid  = data/test.txt\\n  names = data/obj.names\\n  backup = backup/\\n  ```\\n\\n4. Put image-files (.jpg) of your objects in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\obj\\\\`\\n\\n5. You should label each object on images from your dataset. Use this visual GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\nIt will create `.txt`-file for each `.jpg`-image-file - in the same directory and with the same name, but with `.txt`-extension, and put to file: object number and object coordinates on this image, for each object in new line: `<object-class> <x> <y> <width> <height>`\\n\\n  Where: \\n  * `<object-class>` - integer object number from `0` to `(classes-1)`\\n  * `<x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>` - float values relative to width and height of image, it can be equal from (0.0 to 1.0]\\n  * for example: `<x> = <absolute_x> / <image_width>` or `<height> = <absolute_height> / <image_height>`\\n  * atention: `<x_center> <y_center>` - are center of rectangle (are not top-left corner)\\n\\n  For example for `img1.jpg` you will be created `img1.txt` containing:\\n\\n  ```\\n  1 0.716797 0.395833 0.216406 0.147222\\n  0 0.687109 0.379167 0.255469 0.158333\\n  1 0.420312 0.395833 0.140625 0.166667\\n  ```\\n\\n6. Create file `train.txt` in directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, with filenames of your images, each filename in new line, with path relative to `darknet.exe`, for example containing:\\n\\n  ```\\n  data/obj/img1.jpg\\n  data/obj/img2.jpg\\n  data/obj/img3.jpg\\n  ```\\n\\n7. Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (154 MB): https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74 and put to the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64`\\n\\n8. Start training by using the command line: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74`\\n     \\n   To train on Linux use command: `./darknet detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74` (just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`)\\n     \\n   * (file `yolo-obj_last.weights` will be saved to the `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` for each 100 iterations)\\n   * (file `yolo-obj_xxxx.weights` will be saved to the `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` for each 1000 iterations)\\n   * (To disable Loss-Window use `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -dont_show`, if you train on computer without monitor like a cloud Amazaon EC2)\\n\\n8.1. For training with mAP (mean average precisions) calculation for each 4 Epochs (set `valid=valid.txt` or `train.txt` in `obj.data` file) and run: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -map`\\n\\n9. After training is complete - get result `yolo-obj_final.weights` from path `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\`\\n\\n * After each 100 iterations you can stop and later start training from this point. For example, after 2000 iterations you can stop training, and later just copy `yolo-obj_2000.weights` from `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` to `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\` and start training using: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_2000.weights`\\n\\n    (in the original repository https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet the weights-file is saved only once every 10 000 iterations `if(iterations > 1000)`)\\n\\n * Also you can get result earlier than all 45000 iterations.\\n \\n **Note:** If during training you see `nan` values for `avg` (loss) field - then training goes wrong, but if `nan` is in some other lines - then training goes well.\\n \\n **Note:** If you changed width= or height= in your cfg-file, then new width and height must be divisible by 32.\\n \\n **Note:** After training use such command for detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n \\n  **Note:** if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n \\n### How to train tiny-yolo (to detect your custom objects):\\n\\nDo all the same steps as for the full yolo model as described above. With the exception of:\\n* Download default weights file for yolov3-tiny: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights\\n* Get pre-trained weights `yolov3-tiny.conv.15` using command: `darknet.exe partial cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg yolov3-tiny.weights yolov3-tiny.conv.15 15`\\n* Make your custom model `yolov3-tiny-obj.cfg` based on `cfg/yolov3-tiny_obj.cfg` instead of `yolov3.cfg`\\n* Start training: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolov3-tiny-obj.cfg yolov3-tiny.conv.15`\\n\\nFor training Yolo based on other models ([DenseNet201-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/densenet201_yolo.cfg) or [ResNet50-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/resnet50_yolo.cfg)), you can download and get pre-trained weights as showed in this file: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/partial.cmd\\nIf you made you custom model that isn\\'t based on other models, then you can train it without pre-trained weights, then will be used random initial weights.\\n \\n## When should I stop training:\\n\\nUsually sufficient 2000 iterations for each class(object), but not less than 4000 iterations in total. But for a more precise definition when you should stop training, use the following manual:\\n\\n1. During training, you will see varying indicators of error, and you should stop when no longer decreases **0.XXXXXXX avg**:\\n\\n  > Region Avg IOU: 0.798363, Class: 0.893232, Obj: 0.700808, No Obj: 0.004567, Avg Recall: 1.000000,  count: 8\\n  > Region Avg IOU: 0.800677, Class: 0.892181, Obj: 0.701590, No Obj: 0.004574, Avg Recall: 1.000000,  count: 8\\n  >\\n  > **9002**: 0.211667, **0.060730 avg**, 0.001000 rate, 3.868000 seconds, 576128 images\\n  > Loaded: 0.000000 seconds\\n\\n  * **9002** - iteration number (number of batch)\\n  * **0.060730 avg** - average loss (error) - **the lower, the better**\\n\\n  When you see that average loss **0.xxxxxx avg** no longer decreases at many iterations then you should stop training.\\n\\n2. Once training is stopped, you should take some of last `.weights`-files from `darknet\\\\build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup` and choose the best of them:\\n\\nFor example, you stopped training after 9000 iterations, but the best result can give one of previous weights (7000, 8000, 9000). It can happen due to overfitting. **Overfitting** - is case when you can detect objects on images from training-dataset, but can\\'t detect objects on any others images. You should get weights from **Early Stopping Point**:\\n\\n![Overfitting](https://hsto.org/files/5dc/7ae/7fa/5dc7ae7fad9d4e3eb3a484c58bfc1ff5.png) \\n\\nTo get weights from Early Stopping Point:\\n\\n  2.1. At first, in your file `obj.data` you must specify the path to the validation dataset `valid = valid.txt` (format of `valid.txt` as in `train.txt`), and if you haven\\'t validation images, just copy `data\\\\train.txt` to `data\\\\valid.txt`.\\n\\n  2.2 If training is stopped after 9000 iterations, to validate some of previous weights use this commands:\\n\\n(If you use another GitHub repository, then use `darknet.exe detector recall`... instead of `darknet.exe detector map`...)\\n\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_7000.weights`\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_9000.weights`\\n\\nAnd comapre last output lines for each weights (7000, 8000, 9000):\\n\\nChoose weights-file **with the highest mAP (mean average precision)** or IoU (intersect over union)\\n\\nFor example, **bigger mAP** gives weights `yolo-obj_8000.weights` - then **use this weights for detection**.\\n\\nOr just train with `-map` flag: \\n\\n`darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -map` \\n\\nSo you will see mAP-chart (red-line) in the Loss-chart Window. mAP will be calculated for each 4 Epochs using `valid=valid.txt` file that is specified in `obj.data` file (`1 Epoch = images_in_train_txt / batch` iterations)\\n\\n![loss_chart_map_chart](https://hsto.org/webt/yd/vl/ag/ydvlagutof2zcnjodstgroen8ac.jpeg)\\n\\nExample of custom object detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n\\n* **IoU** (intersect over union) - average instersect over union of objects and detections for a certain threshold = 0.24\\n\\n* **mAP** (mean average precision) - mean value of `average precisions` for each class, where `average precision` is average value of 11 points on PR-curve for each possible threshold (each probability of detection) for the same class (Precision-Recall in terms of PascalVOC, where Precision=TP/(TP+FP) and Recall=TP/(TP+FN) ), page-11: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/postscript/ijcv_voc09.pdf\\n\\n**mAP** is default metric of precision in the PascalVOC competition, **this is the same as AP50** metric in the MS COCO competition.\\nIn terms of Wiki, indicators Precision and Recall have a slightly different meaning than in the PascalVOC competition, but **IoU always has the same meaning**.\\n\\n![precision_recall_iou](https://hsto.org/files/ca8/866/d76/ca8866d76fb840228940dbf442a7f06a.jpg)\\n\\n### How to calculate mAP on PascalVOC 2007:\\n\\n1. To calculate mAP (mean average precision) on PascalVOC-2007-test:\\n* Download PascalVOC dataset, install Python 3.x and get file `2007_test.txt` as described here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-train-pascal-voc-data\\n* Then download file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/scripts/voc_label_difficult.py to the dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\` then run `voc_label_difficult.py` to get the file `difficult_2007_test.txt`\\n* Remove symbol `#` from this line to un-comment it: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/data/voc.data#L4\\n* Then there are 2 ways to get mAP:\\n    1. Using Darknet + Python: run the file `build/darknet/x64/calc_mAP_voc_py.cmd` - you will get mAP for `yolo-voc.cfg` model, mAP = 75.9%\\n    2. Using this fork of Darknet: run the file `build/darknet/x64/calc_mAP.cmd` - you will get mAP for `yolo-voc.cfg` model, mAP = 75.8%\\n    \\n (The article specifies the value of mAP = 76.8% for YOLOv2 416Ã\\x97416, page-4 table-3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242v1.pdf. We get values lower - perhaps due to the fact that the model was trained on a slightly different source code than the code on which the detection is was done)\\n\\n* if you want to get mAP for `tiny-yolo-voc.cfg` model, then un-comment line for tiny-yolo-voc.cfg and comment line for yolo-voc.cfg in the .cmd-file\\n* if you have Python 2.x instead of Python 3.x, and if you use Darknet+Python-way to get mAP, then in your cmd-file use `reval_voc.py` and `voc_eval.py` instead of `reval_voc_py3.py` and `voc_eval_py3.py` from this directory: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/master/scripts\\n\\n### Custom object detection:\\n\\nExample of custom object detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n\\n| ![Yolo_v2_training](https://hsto.org/files/d12/1e7/515/d121e7515f6a4eb694913f10de5f2b61.jpg) | ![Yolo_v2_training](https://hsto.org/files/727/c7e/5e9/727c7e5e99bf4d4aa34027bb6a5e4bab.jpg) |\\n|---|---|\\n\\n## How to improve object detection:\\n\\n1. Before training:\\n  * set flag `random=1` in your `.cfg`-file - it will increase precision by training Yolo for different resolutions: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L788)\\n\\n  * increase network resolution in your `.cfg`-file (`height=608`, `width=608` or any value multiple of 32) - it will increase precision\\n\\n  * recalculate anchors for your dataset for `width` and `height` from cfg-file:\\n  `darknet.exe detector calc_anchors data/obj.data -num_of_clusters 9 -width 416 -height 416`\\n   then set the same 9 `anchors` in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers in your cfg-file\\n\\n  * check that each object are mandatory labeled in your dataset - no one object in your data set should not be without label. In the most training issues - there are wrong labels in your dataset (got labels by using some conversion script, marked with a third-party tool, ...). Always check your dataset by using: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\n  * desirable that your training dataset include images with objects at diffrent: scales, rotations, lightings, from different sides, on different backgrounds - you should preferably have 2000 different images for each class or more, and you should train `2000*classes` iterations or more\\n\\n  * desirable that your training dataset include images with non-labeled objects that you do not want to detect - negative samples without bounded box (empty `.txt` files) - use as many images of negative samples as there are images with objects\\n\\n  * for training with a large number of objects in each image, add the parameter `max=200` or higher value in the last `[yolo]`-layer or `[region]`-layer in your cfg-file (the global maximum number of objects that can be detected by YoloV3 is `0,0615234375*(width*height)` where are width and height are parameters from `[net]` section in cfg-file) \\n  \\n  * for training for small objects - set `layers = -1, 11` instead of https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6390a5a2ab61a0bdf6f1a9a6b4a739c16b36e0d7/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L720\\n      and set `stride=4` instead of https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6390a5a2ab61a0bdf6f1a9a6b4a739c16b36e0d7/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L717\\n  \\n  * If you train the model to distinguish Left and Right objects as separate classes (left/right hand, left/right-turn on road signs, ...) then for disabling flip data augmentation - add `flip=0` here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/3d2d0a7c98dbc8923d9ff705b81ff4f7940ea6ff/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L17\\n  \\n  * General rule - your training dataset should include such a set of relative sizes of objects that you want to detect: \\n\\n    * `train_network_width * train_obj_width / train_image_width ~= detection_network_width * detection_obj_width / detection_image_width`\\n    * `train_network_height * train_obj_height / train_image_height ~= detection_network_height * detection_obj_height / detection_image_height`\\n    \\n    I.e. for each object from Test dataset there must be at least 1 object in the Training dataset with about the same relative size:\\n\\n    `object width in percent from Training dataset` ~= `object width in percent from Test dataset` \\n   \\n    That is, if only objects that occupied 80-90% of the image were present in the training set, then the trained network will not be able to detect objects that occupy 1-10% of the image.\\n    \\n  * to speedup training (with decreasing detection accuracy) do Fine-Tuning instead of Transfer-Learning, set param `stopbackward=1` here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6d44529cf93211c319813c90e0c1adb34426abe5/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L548\\n    then do this command: `./darknet partial cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights yolov3.conv.81 81` will be created file `yolov3.conv.81`,\\n    then train by using weights file `yolov3.conv.81` instead of `darknet53.conv.74`\\n\\n\\n2. After training - for detection:\\n\\n  * Increase network-resolution by set in your `.cfg`-file (`height=608` and `width=608`) or (`height=832` and `width=832`) or (any value multiple of 32) - this increases the precision and makes it possible to detect small objects: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L8-L9)\\n  \\n    * it is not necessary to train the network again, just use `.weights`-file already trained for 416x416 resolution\\n    * but to get even greater accuracy you should train with higher resolution 608x608 or 832x832, note: if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n\\n## How to mark bounded boxes of objects and create annotation files:\\n\\nHere you can find repository with GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\nWith example of: `train.txt`, `obj.names`, `obj.data`, `yolo-obj.cfg`, `air`1-6`.txt`, `bird`1-4`.txt` for 2 classes of objects (air, bird) and `train_obj.cmd` with example how to train this image-set with Yolo v2 & v3\\n\\n## Using Yolo9000\\n\\n Simultaneous detection and classification of 9000 objects: `darknet.exe detector test cfg/combine9k.data cfg/yolo9000.cfg yolo9000.weights data/dog.jpg`\\n\\n* `yolo9000.weights` - (186 MB Yolo9000 Model) requires 4 GB GPU-RAM: http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo9000.weights\\n\\n* `yolo9000.cfg` - cfg-file of the Yolo9000, also there are paths to the `9k.tree` and `coco9k.map`  https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/617cf313ccb1fe005db3f7d88dec04a04bd97cc2/cfg/yolo9000.cfg#L217-L218\\n\\n    * `9k.tree` - **WordTree** of 9418 categories  - `<label> <parent_it>`, if `parent_id == -1` then this label hasn\\'t parent: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.tree\\n\\n    * `coco9k.map` - map 80 categories from MSCOCO to WordTree `9k.tree`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/coco9k.map\\n\\n* `combine9k.data` - data file, there are paths to: `9k.labels`, `9k.names`, `inet9k.map`, (change path to your `combine9k.train.list`): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/combine9k.data\\n\\n    * `9k.labels` - 9418 labels of objects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.labels\\n\\n    * `9k.names` -\\n9418 names of objects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.names\\n\\n    * `inet9k.map` - map 200 categories from ImageNet to WordTree `9k.tree`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/inet9k.map\\n\\n\\n## How to use Yolo as DLL\\n\\n1.

Any questions or discussions are welcomed! \\r\\n\\r\\n## Abstract \\r\\n\\r\\nDetection identifies objects as axis-aligned boxes in an image. Most successful object detectors enumerate a nearly exhaustive list of potential object locations and classify each. This is wasteful, inefficient, and requires additional post-processing. In this paper, we take a different approach. We model an object as a single point -- the center point of its bounding box. Our detector uses keypoint estimation to find center points and regresses to all other object properties, such as size, 3D location, orientation, and even pose. Our center point based approach, CenterNet, is end-to-end differentiable, simpler, faster, and more accurate than corresponding bounding box based detectors. CenterNet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off on the MS COCO dataset, with 28.1% AP at 142 FPS, 37.4% AP at 52 FPS, and 45.1% AP with multi-scale testing at 1.4 FPS. We use the same approach to estimate 3D bounding box in the KITTI benchmark and human pose on the COCO keypoint dataset. Our method performs competitively with sophisticated multi-stage methods and runs in real-time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Highlights\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Simple:** One-sentence method summary: use keypoint detection technic to detect the bounding box center point and regress to all other object properties like bounding box size, 3d information, and pose.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Versatile:** The same framework works for object detection, 3d bounding box estimation, and multi-person pose estimation with minor modification.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Fast:** The whole process in a single network feedforward. No NMS post processing is needed. Our DLA-34 model runs at *52* FPS with *37.4* COCO AP.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Strong**: Our best single model achieves *45.1*AP on COCO test-dev.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Easy to use:** We provide user friendly testing API and webcam demos.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main results\\r\\n\\r\\n### Object Detection on COCO validation\\r\\n\\r\\n| Backbone     |  AP / FPS | Flip AP / FPS|  Multi-scale AP / FPS |\\r\\n|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|\\r\\n|Hourglass-104 | 40.3 / 14 | 42.2 / 7.8   | 45.1 / 1.4            |\\r\\n|DLA-34        | 37.4 / 52 | 39.2 / 28    | 41.7 / 4              |\\r\\n|ResNet-101    | 34.6 / 45 | 36.2 / 25    | 39.3 / 4              |\\r\\n|ResNet-18     | 28.1 / 142| 30.0 / 71    | 33.2 / 12             |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Keypoint detection on COCO validation\\r\\n\\r\\n| Backbone     |  AP       |  FPS         |\\r\\n|--------------|-----------|--------------|\\r\\n|Hourglass-104 | 64.0      |    6.6       |\\r\\n|DLA-34        | 58.9      |    23        |\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3D bounding box detection on KITTI validation\\r\\n\\r\\n|Backbone|FPS|AP-E|AP-M|AP-H|AOS-E|AOS-M|AOS-H|BEV-E|BEV-M|BEV-H| \\r\\n|--------|---|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\\r\\n|DLA-34  |32 |96.9|87.8|79.2|93.9 |84.3 |75.7 |34.0 |30.5 |26.8 |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll models and details are available in our [Model zoo](readme/MODEL_ZOO.md).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Installation\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to [INSTALL.md](readme/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use CenterNet\\r\\n\\r\\nWe support demo for image/ image folder, video, and webcam. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, download the models (By default, [ctdet_coco_dla_2x](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pl_-ael8wERdUREEnaIfqOV_VF2bEVRT) for detection and \\r\\n[multi_pose_dla_3x](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PO1Ax_GDtjiemEmDVD7oPWwqQkUu28PI) for human pose estimation) \\r\\nfrom the [Model zoo](readme/MODEL_ZOO.md) and put them in `CenterNet_ROOT/models/`.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor object detection on images/ video, run:\\r\\n\\r\\n~~~\\r\\npython demo.py ctdet --demo /path/to/image/or/folder/or/video --load_model ../models/ctdet_coco_dla_2x.pth\\r\\n~~~\\r\\nWe provide example images in `CenterNet_ROOT/images/` (from [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/tree/master/demo)).

Replace the address below, on shown in the phone application (Smart WebCam) and launch:\\n\\n\\n* Yolo v3 COCO-model: `darknet.exe detector demo data/coco.data yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights http://192.168.0.80:8080/video?dummy=param.mjpg -i 0`\\n\\n\\n### How to compile on Linux:\\n\\nJust do `make` in the darknet directory.\\nBefore make, you can set such options in the `Makefile`: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/9c1b9a2cf6363546c152251be578a21f3c3caec6/Makefile#L1)\\n* `GPU=1` to build with CUDA to accelerate by using GPU (CUDA should be in `/usr/local/cuda`)\\n* `CUDNN=1` to build with cuDNN v5-v7 to accelerate training by using GPU (cuDNN should be in `/usr/local/cudnn`)\\n* `CUDNN_HALF=1` to build for Tensor Cores (on Titan V / Tesla V100 / DGX-2 and later) speedup Detection 3x, Training 2x\\n* `OPENCV=1` to build with OpenCV 3.x/2.4.x - allows to detect on video files and video streams from network cameras or web-cams\\n* `DEBUG=1` to bould debug version of Yolo\\n* `OPENMP=1` to build with OpenMP support to accelerate Yolo by using multi-core CPU\\n* `LIBSO=1` to build a library `darknet.so` and binary runable file `uselib` that uses this library. Or you can try to run so `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib test.mp4` How to use this SO-library from your own code - you can look at C++ example: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/src/yolo_console_dll.cpp\\n    or use in such a way: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib data/coco.names cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights test.mp4`\\n\\nTo run Darknet on Linux use examples from this article, just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`, i.e. use this command: `./darknet detector test ./cfg/coco.data ./cfg/yolov3.cfg ./yolov3.weights`\\n\\n### How to compile on Windows:\\n\\n1. If you have **MSVS 2015, CUDA 10.0, cuDNN 7.4 and OpenCV 3.x** (with paths: `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include` & `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`), then start MSVS, open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet.sln`, set **x64** and **Release** https://hsto.org/webt/uh/fk/-e/uhfk-eb0q-hwd9hsxhrikbokd6u.jpeg and do the: Build -> Build darknet. Also add Windows system variable `cudnn` with path to CUDNN: https://hsto.org/files/a49/3dc/fc4/a493dcfc4bd34a1295fd15e0e2e01f26.jpg **NOTE:** If installing OpenCV, use OpenCV 3.4.0 or earlier. This is a bug in OpenCV 3.4.1 in the C API (see [#500](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/issues/500)).\\n\\n    1.1. Find files `opencv_world320.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg320_64.dll` (or `opencv_world340.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg340_64.dll`) in `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\bin` and put it near with `darknet.exe`\\n    \\n    1.2 Check that there are `bin` and `include` folders in the `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\\\CUDA\\\\v10.0` if aren\\'t, then copy them to this folder from the path where is CUDA installed\\n    \\n    1.3. To install CUDNN (speedup neural network), do the following:\\n      \\n    * download and install **cuDNN v7.4.1 for CUDA 10.0**: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn\\n      \\n    * add Windows system variable `cudnn` with path to CUDNN: https://hsto.org/files/a49/3dc/fc4/a493dcfc4bd34a1295fd15e0e2e01f26.jpg\\n    \\n    1.4. If you want to build **without CUDNN** then: open `\\\\darknet.sln` -> (right click on project) -> properties  -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions, and remove this: `CUDNN;`\\n\\n2. If you have other version of **CUDA (not 10.0)** then open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet.vcxproj` by using Notepad, find 2 places with \"CUDA 10.0\" and change it to your CUDA-version, then do step 1\\n\\n3. If you **don\\'t have GPU**, but have **MSVS 2015 and OpenCV 3.0** (with paths: `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include` & `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`), then start MSVS, open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet_no_gpu.sln`, set **x64** and **Release**, and do the: Build -> Build darknet_no_gpu\\n\\n4. If you have **OpenCV 2.4.13** instead of 3.0 then you should change pathes after `\\\\darknet.sln` is opened\\n\\n    4.1 (right click on project) -> properties  -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories:  `C:\\\\opencv_2.4.13\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include`\\n  \\n    4.2 (right click on project) -> properties  -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories: `C:\\\\opencv_2.4.13\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`\\n    \\n5. If you have GPU with Tensor Cores (nVidia Titan V / Tesla V100 / DGX-2 and later) speedup Detection 3x, Training 2x:\\n    `\\\\darknet.sln` -> (right click on project) -> properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions, and add here: `CUDNN_HALF;`\\n    \\n    **Note:** CUDA must be installed only after that MSVS2015 had been installed.\\n\\n### How to compile (custom):\\n\\nAlso, you can to create your own `darknet.sln` & `darknet.vcxproj`, this example for CUDA 9.1 and OpenCV 3.0\\n\\nThen add to your created project:\\n- (right click on project) -> properties  -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories, put here: \\n\\n`C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include;..\\\\..\\\\3rdparty\\\\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories);$(CudaToolkitIncludeDir);$(cudnn)\\\\include`\\n- (right click on project) -> Build dependecies -> Build Customizations -> set check on CUDA 9.1 or what version you have - for example as here: http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VS2013-R-5.jpg\\n- add to project all `.c` & `.cu` files and file `http_stream.cpp` from `\\\\src`\\n- (right click on project) -> properties  -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories, put here: \\n\\n`C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib;$(CUDA_PATH)lib\\\\$(PlatformName);$(cudnn)\\\\lib\\\\x64;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)`\\n-  (right click on project) -> properties  -> Linker -> Input -> Additional dependecies, put here: \\n\\n`..\\\\..\\\\3rdparty\\\\lib\\\\x64\\\\pthreadVC2.lib;cublas.lib;curand.lib;cudart.lib;cudnn.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)`\\n- (right click on project) -> properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions\\n\\n`OPENCV;_TIMESPEC_DEFINED;_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS;_CRT_RAND_S;WIN32;NDEBUG;_CONSOLE;_LIB;%(PreprocessorDefinitions)`\\n\\n- compile to .exe (X64 & Release) and put .dll-s near with .exe: https://hsto.org/webt/uh/fk/-e/uhfk-eb0q-hwd9hsxhrikbokd6u.jpeg\\n\\n    * `pthreadVC2.dll, pthreadGC2.dll` from \\\\3rdparty\\\\dll\\\\x64\\n\\n    * `cusolver64_91.dll, curand64_91.dll, cudart64_91.dll, cublas64_91.dll` - 91 for CUDA 9.1 or your version, from C:\\\\Program Files\\\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\\\CUDA\\\\v9.1\\\\bin\\n\\n    * For OpenCV 3.2: `opencv_world320.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg320_64.dll` from `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\bin` \\n    * For OpenCV 2.4.13: `opencv_core2413.dll`, `opencv_highgui2413.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg2413_64.dll` from  `C:\\\\opencv_2.4.13\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\bin`\\n\\n## How to train (Pascal VOC Data):\\n\\n1. Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (154 MB): http://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74 and put to the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64`\\n\\n2. Download The Pascal VOC Data and unpack it to directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc` will be created dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc\\\\VOCdevkit\\\\`:\\n    * http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar\\n    * http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\\n    * http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar\\n    \\n    2.1 Download file `voc_label.py` to dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc`: http://pjreddie.com/media/files/voc_label.py\\n\\n3. Download and install Python for Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-amd64.exe\\n\\n4. Run command: `python build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc\\\\voc_label.py` (to generate files: 2007_test.txt, 2007_train.txt, 2007_val.txt, 2012_train.txt, 2012_val.txt)\\n\\n5. Run command: `type 2007_train.txt 2007_val.txt 2012_*.txt > train.txt`\\n\\n6. Set `batch=64` and `subdivisions=8` in the file `yolov3-voc.cfg`: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/ee38c6e1513fb089b35be4ffa692afd9b3f65747/cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg#L3-L4)\\n\\n7. Start training by using `train_voc.cmd` or by using the command line: \\n\\n    `darknet.exe detector train data/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg darknet53.conv.74` \\n\\n(**Note:** To disable Loss-Window use flag `-dont_show`. If you are using CPU, try `darknet_no_gpu.exe` instead of `darknet.exe`.)\\n\\nIf required change pathes in the file `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc.data`\\n\\nMore information about training by the link: http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/#train-voc\\n\\n **Note:** If during training you see `nan` values for `avg` (loss) field - then training goes wrong, but if `nan` is in some other lines - then training goes well.\\n\\n## How to train with multi-GPU:\\n\\n1. Train it first on 1 GPU for like 1000 iterations: `darknet.exe detector train data/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg darknet53.conv.74`\\n\\n2. Then stop and by using partially-trained model `/backup/yolov3-voc_1000.weights` run training with multigpu (up to 4 GPUs): `darknet.exe detector train data/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg /backup/yolov3-voc_1000.weights -gpus 0,1,2,3`\\n\\nOnly for small datasets sometimes better to decrease learning rate, for 4 GPUs set `learning_rate = 0.00025` (i.e. learning_rate = 0.001 / GPUs). In this case also increase 4x times `burn_in =` and `max_batches =` in your cfg-file. I.e. use `burn_in = 4000` instead of `1000`.\\n\\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/darknet/NbJqonJBTSY/Te5PfIpuCAAJ\\n\\n## How to train (to detect your custom objects):\\n(to train old Yolo v2 `yolov2-voc.cfg`, `yolov2-tiny-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.2.0.cfg`, ...

Create file `yolo-obj.cfg` with the same content as in `yolov3.cfg` (or copy `yolov3.cfg` to `yolo-obj.cfg)` and:\\n\\n  * change line batch to [`batch=64`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L3)\\n  * change line subdivisions to [`subdivisions=8`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n  * change line `classes=80` to your number of objects in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers:\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L610\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L696\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L783\\n  * change [`filters=255`] to filters=(classes + 5)x3 in the 3 `[convolutional]` before each `[yolo]` layer\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L603\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L689\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L776\\n\\n  So if `classes=1` then should be `filters=18`. If `classes=2` then write `filters=21`.\\n  \\n  **(Do not write in the cfg-file: filters=(classes + 5)x3)**\\n  \\n  (Generally `filters` depends on the `classes`, `coords` and number of `mask`s, i.e. filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*<number of mask>`, where `mask` is indices of anchors. If `mask` is absence, then filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*num`)\\n\\n  So for example, for 2 objects, your file `yolo-obj.cfg` should differ from `yolov3.cfg` in such lines in each of **3** [yolo]-layers:\\n\\n  ```\\n  [convolutional]\\n  filters=21\\n\\n  [region]\\n  classes=2\\n  ```\\n\\n2. Create file `obj.names` in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, with objects names - each in new line\\n\\n3. Create file `obj.data` in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, containing (where **classes = number of objects**):\\n\\n  ```\\n  classes= 2\\n  train  = data/train.txt\\n  valid  = data/test.txt\\n  names = data/obj.names\\n  backup = backup/\\n  ```\\n\\n4. Put image-files (.jpg) of your objects in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\obj\\\\`\\n\\n5. You should label each object on images from your dataset. Use this visual GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\nIt will create `.txt`-file for each `.jpg`-image-file - in the same directory and with the same name, but with `.txt`-extension, and put to file: object number and object coordinates on this image, for each object in new line: `<object-class> <x> <y> <width> <height>`\\n\\n  Where: \\n  * `<object-class>` - integer object number from `0` to `(classes-1)`\\n  * `<x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>` - float values relative to width and height of image, it can be equal from (0.0 to 1.0]\\n  * for example: `<x> = <absolute_x> / <image_width>` or `<height> = <absolute_height> / <image_height>`\\n  * atention: `<x_center> <y_center>` - are center of rectangle (are not top-left corner)\\n\\n  For example for `img1.jpg` you will be created `img1.txt` containing:\\n\\n  ```\\n  1 0.716797 0.395833 0.216406 0.147222\\n  0 0.687109 0.379167 0.255469 0.158333\\n  1 0.420312 0.395833 0.140625 0.166667\\n  ```\\n\\n6. Create file `train.txt` in directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, with filenames of your images, each filename in new line, with path relative to `darknet.exe`, for example containing:\\n\\n  ```\\n  data/obj/img1.jpg\\n  data/obj/img2.jpg\\n  data/obj/img3.jpg\\n  ```\\n\\n7. Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (154 MB): https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74 and put to the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64`\\n\\n8. Start training by using the command line: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74`\\n     \\n   To train on Linux use command: `./darknet detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74` (just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`)\\n     \\n   * (file `yolo-obj_last.weights` will be saved to the `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` for each 100 iterations)\\n   * (file `yolo-obj_xxxx.weights` will be saved to the `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` for each 1000 iterations)\\n   * (To disable Loss-Window use `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -dont_show`, if you train on computer without monitor like a cloud Amazaon EC2)\\n\\n8.1. For training with mAP (mean average precisions) calculation for each 4 Epochs (set `valid=valid.txt` or `train.txt` in `obj.data` file) and run: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -map`\\n\\n9. After training is complete - get result `yolo-obj_final.weights` from path `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\`\\n\\n * After each 100 iterations you can stop and later start training from this point. For example, after 2000 iterations you can stop training, and later just copy `yolo-obj_2000.weights` from `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` to `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\` and start training using: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_2000.weights`\\n\\n    (in the original repository https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet the weights-file is saved only once every 10 000 iterations `if(iterations > 1000)`)\\n\\n * Also you can get result earlier than all 45000 iterations.\\n \\n **Note:** If during training you see `nan` values for `avg` (loss) field - then training goes wrong, but if `nan` is in some other lines - then training goes well.\\n \\n **Note:** If you changed width= or height= in your cfg-file, then new width and height must be divisible by 32.\\n \\n **Note:** After training use such command for detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n \\n  **Note:** if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n \\n### How to train tiny-yolo (to detect your custom objects):\\n\\nDo all the same steps as for the full yolo model as described above. With the exception of:\\n* Download default weights file for yolov3-tiny: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights\\n* Get pre-trained weights `yolov3-tiny.conv.15` using command: `darknet.exe partial cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg yolov3-tiny.weights yolov3-tiny.conv.15 15`\\n* Make your custom model `yolov3-tiny-obj.cfg` based on `cfg/yolov3-tiny_obj.cfg` instead of `yolov3.cfg`\\n* Start training: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolov3-tiny-obj.cfg yolov3-tiny.conv.15`\\n\\nFor training Yolo based on other models ([DenseNet201-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/densenet201_yolo.cfg) or [ResNet50-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/resnet50_yolo.cfg)), you can download and get pre-trained weights as showed in this file: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/partial.cmd\\nIf you made you custom model that isn\\'t based on other models, then you can train it without pre-trained weights, then will be used random initial weights.\\n \\n## When should I stop training:\\n\\nUsually sufficient 2000 iterations for each class(object), but not less than 4000 iterations in total. But for a more precise definition when you should stop training, use the following manual:\\n\\n1. During training, you will see varying indicators of error, and you should stop when no longer decreases **0.XXXXXXX avg**:\\n\\n  > Region Avg IOU: 0.798363, Class: 0.893232, Obj: 0.700808, No Obj: 0.004567, Avg Recall: 1.000000,  count: 8\\n  > Region Avg IOU: 0.800677, Class: 0.892181, Obj: 0.701590, No Obj: 0.004574, Avg Recall: 1.000000,  count: 8\\n  >\\n  > **9002**: 0.211667, **0.060730 avg**, 0.001000 rate, 3.868000 seconds, 576128 images\\n  > Loaded: 0.000000 seconds\\n\\n  * **9002** - iteration number (number of batch)\\n  * **0.060730 avg** - average loss (error) - **the lower, the better**\\n\\n  When you see that average loss **0.xxxxxx avg** no longer decreases at many iterations then you should stop training.\\n\\n2. Once training is stopped, you should take some of last `.weights`-files from `darknet\\\\build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup` and choose the best of them:\\n\\nFor example, you stopped training after 9000 iterations, but the best result can give one of previous weights (7000, 8000, 9000). It can happen due to overfitting. **Overfitting** - is case when you can detect objects on images from training-dataset, but can\\'t detect objects on any others images. You should get weights from **Early Stopping Point**:\\n\\n![Overfitting](https://hsto.org/files/5dc/7ae/7fa/5dc7ae7fad9d4e3eb3a484c58bfc1ff5.png) \\n\\nTo get weights from Early Stopping Point:\\n\\n  2.1. At first, in your file `obj.data` you must specify the path to the validation dataset `valid = valid.txt` (format of `valid.txt` as in `train.txt`), and if you haven\\'t validation images, just copy `data\\\\train.txt` to `data\\\\valid.txt`.\\n\\n  2.2 If training is stopped after 9000 iterations, to validate some of previous weights use this commands:\\n\\n(If you use another GitHub repository, then use `darknet.exe detector recall`... instead of `darknet.exe detector map`...)\\n\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_7000.weights`\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_9000.weights`\\n\\nAnd comapre last output lines for each weights (7000, 8000, 9000):\\n\\nChoose weights-file **with the highest mAP (mean average precision)** or IoU (intersect over union)\\n\\nFor example, **bigger mAP** gives weights `yolo-obj_8000.weights` - then **use this weights for detection**.\\n\\nOr just train with `-map` flag: \\n\\n`darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -map` \\n\\nSo you will see mAP-chart (red-line) in the Loss-chart Window. mAP will be calculated for each 4 Epochs using `valid=valid.txt` file that is specified in `obj.data` file (`1 Epoch = images_in_train_txt / batch` iterations)\\n\\n![loss_chart_map_chart](https://hsto.org/webt/yd/vl/ag/ydvlagutof2zcnjodstgroen8ac.jpeg)\\n\\nExample of custom object detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n\\n* **IoU** (intersect over union) - average instersect over union of objects and detections for a certain threshold = 0.24\\n\\n* **mAP** (mean average precision) - mean value of `average precisions` for each class, where `average precision` is average value of 11 points on PR-curve for each possible threshold (each probability of detection) for the same class (Precision-Recall in terms of PascalVOC, where Precision=TP/(TP+FP) and Recall=TP/(TP+FN) ), page-11: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/postscript/ijcv_voc09.pdf\\n\\n**mAP** is default metric of precision in the PascalVOC competition, **this is the same as AP50** metric in the MS COCO competition.\\nIn terms of Wiki, indicators Precision and Recall have a slightly different meaning than in the PascalVOC competition, but **IoU always has the same meaning**.\\n\\n![precision_recall_iou](https://hsto.org/files/ca8/866/d76/ca8866d76fb840228940dbf442a7f06a.jpg)\\n\\n### How to calculate mAP on PascalVOC 2007:\\n\\n1. To calculate mAP (mean average precision) on PascalVOC-2007-test:\\n* Download PascalVOC dataset, install Python 3.x and get file `2007_test.txt` as described here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-train-pascal-voc-data\\n* Then download file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/scripts/voc_label_difficult.py to the dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\` then run `voc_label_difficult.py` to get the file `difficult_2007_test.txt`\\n* Remove symbol `#` from this line to un-comment it: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/data/voc.data#L4\\n* Then there are 2 ways to get mAP:\\n    1. Using Darknet + Python: run the file `build/darknet/x64/calc_mAP_voc_py.cmd` - you will get mAP for `yolo-voc.cfg` model, mAP = 75.9%\\n    2. Using this fork of Darknet: run the file `build/darknet/x64/calc_mAP.cmd` - you will get mAP for `yolo-voc.cfg` model, mAP = 75.8%\\n    \\n (The article specifies the value of mAP = 76.8% for YOLOv2 416Ã\\x97416, page-4 table-3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242v1.pdf. We get values lower - perhaps due to the fact that the model was trained on a slightly different source code than the code on which the detection is was done)\\n\\n* if you want to get mAP for `tiny-yolo-voc.cfg` model, then un-comment line for tiny-yolo-voc.cfg and comment line for yolo-voc.cfg in the .cmd-file\\n* if you have Python 2.x instead of Python 3.x, and if you use Darknet+Python-way to get mAP, then in your cmd-file use `reval_voc.py` and `voc_eval.py` instead of `reval_voc_py3.py` and `voc_eval_py3.py` from this directory: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/master/scripts\\n\\n### Custom object detection:\\n\\nExample of custom object detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n\\n| ![Yolo_v2_training](https://hsto.org/files/d12/1e7/515/d121e7515f6a4eb694913f10de5f2b61.jpg) | ![Yolo_v2_training](https://hsto.org/files/727/c7e/5e9/727c7e5e99bf4d4aa34027bb6a5e4bab.jpg) |\\n|---|---|\\n\\n## How to improve object detection:\\n\\n1. Before training:\\n  * set flag `random=1` in your `.cfg`-file - it will increase precision by training Yolo for different resolutions: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L788)\\n\\n  * increase network resolution in your `.cfg`-file (`height=608`, `width=608` or any value multiple of 32) - it will increase precision\\n\\n  * recalculate anchors for your dataset for `width` and `height` from cfg-file:\\n  `darknet.exe detector calc_anchors data/obj.data -num_of_clusters 9 -width 416 -height 416`\\n   then set the same 9 `anchors` in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers in your cfg-file\\n\\n  * check that each object are mandatory labeled in your dataset - no one object in your data set should not be without label. In the most training issues - there are wrong labels in your dataset (got labels by using some conversion script, marked with a third-party tool, ...). Always check your dataset by using: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\n  * desirable that your training dataset include images with objects at diffrent: scales, rotations, lightings, from different sides, on different backgrounds - you should preferably have 2000 different images for each class or more, and you should train `2000*classes` iterations or more\\n\\n  * desirable that your training dataset include images with non-labeled objects that you do not want to detect - negative samples without bounded box (empty `.txt` files) - use as many images of negative samples as there are images with objects\\n\\n  * for training with a large number of objects in each image, add the parameter `max=200` or higher value in the last `[yolo]`-layer or `[region]`-layer in your cfg-file (the global maximum number of objects that can be detected by YoloV3 is `0,0615234375*(width*height)` where are width and height are parameters from `[net]` section in cfg-file) \\n  \\n  * for training for small objects - set `layers = -1, 11` instead of https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6390a5a2ab61a0bdf6f1a9a6b4a739c16b36e0d7/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L720\\n      and set `stride=4` instead of https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6390a5a2ab61a0bdf6f1a9a6b4a739c16b36e0d7/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L717\\n  \\n  * for training for both small and large objects use modified models:\\n      * Full-model: 5 yolo layers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3_5l.cfg\\n      * Tiny-model: 3 yolo layers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3-tiny_3l.cfg\\n      * Spatial-full-model: 3 yolo layers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\\n  \\n  * If you train the model to distinguish Left and Right objects as separate classes (left/right hand, left/right-turn on road signs, ...) then for disabling flip data augmentation - add `flip=0` here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/3d2d0a7c98dbc8923d9ff705b81ff4f7940ea6ff/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L17\\n  \\n  * General rule - your training dataset should include such a set of relative sizes of objects that you want to detect: \\n\\n    * `train_network_width * train_obj_width / train_image_width ~= detection_network_width * detection_obj_width / detection_image_width`\\n    * `train_network_height * train_obj_height / train_image_height ~= detection_network_height * detection_obj_height / detection_image_height`\\n    \\n    I.e. for each object from Test dataset there must be at least 1 object in the Training dataset with about the same relative size:\\n\\n    `object width in percent from Training dataset` ~= `object width in percent from Test dataset` \\n   \\n    That is, if only objects that occupied 80-90% of the image were present in the training set, then the trained network will not be able to detect objects that occupy 1-10% of the image.\\n    \\n  * to speedup training (with decreasing detection accuracy) do Fine-Tuning instead of Transfer-Learning, set param `stopbackward=1` here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6d44529cf93211c319813c90e0c1adb34426abe5/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L548\\n    then do this command: `./darknet partial cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights yolov3.conv.81 81` will be created file `yolov3.conv.81`,\\n    then train by using weights file `yolov3.conv.81` instead of `darknet53.conv.74`\\n\\n\\n2. After training - for detection:\\n\\n  * Increase network-resolution by set in your `.cfg`-file (`height=608` and `width=608`) or (`height=832` and `width=832`) or (any value multiple of 32) - this increases the precision and makes it possible to detect small objects: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L8-L9)\\n  \\n    * it is not necessary to train the network again, just use `.weights`-file already trained for 416x416 resolution\\n    * but to get even greater accuracy you should train with higher resolution 608x608 or 832x832, note: if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n\\n## How to mark bounded boxes of objects and create annotation files:\\n\\nHere you can find repository with GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\nWith example of: `train.txt`, `obj.names`, `obj.data`, `yolo-obj.cfg`, `air`1-6`.txt`, `bird`1-4`.txt` for 2 classes of objects (air, bird) and `train_obj.cmd` with example how to train this image-set with Yolo v2 & v3\\n\\n## Using Yolo9000\\n\\n Simultaneous detection and classification of 9000 objects: `darknet.exe detector test cfg/combine9k.data cfg/yolo9000.cfg yolo9000.weights data/dog.jpg`\\n\\n* `yolo9000.weights` - (186 MB Yolo9000 Model) requires 4 GB GPU-RAM: http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo9000.weights\\n\\n* `yolo9000.cfg` - cfg-file of the Yolo9000, also there are paths to the `9k.tree` and `coco9k.map`  https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/617cf313ccb1fe005db3f7d88dec04a04bd97cc2/cfg/yolo9000.cfg#L217-L218\\n\\n    * `9k.tree` - **WordTree** of 9418 categories  - `<label> <parent_it>`, if `parent_id == -1` then this label hasn\\'t parent: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.tree\\n\\n    * `coco9k.map` - map 80 categories from MSCOCO to WordTree `9k.tree`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/coco9k.map\\n\\n* `combine9k.data` - data file, there are paths to: `9k.labels`, `9k.names`, `inet9k.map`, (change path to your `combine9k.train.list`): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/combine9k.data\\n\\n    * `9k.labels` - 9418 labels of objects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.labels\\n\\n    * `9k.names` -\\n9418 names of objects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.names\\n\\n    * `inet9k.map` - map 200 categories from ImageNet to WordTree `9k.tree`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/inet9k.map\\n\\n\\n## How to use Yolo as DLL\\n\\n1. To compile Yolo as C++ DLL-file `yolo_cpp_dll.dll` - open in MSVS2015 file `build\\\\darknet\\\\yolo_cpp_dll.sln`, set **x64** and **Release**, and do the: Build -> Build yolo_cpp_dll\\n    * You should have installed **CUDA 10.0**\\n    * To use cuDNN do: (right click on project) -> properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions, and add at the beginning of line: `CUDNN;`\\n\\n2. To use Yolo as DLL-file in your C++ console application - open in MSVS2015 file `build\\\\darknet\\\\yolo_console_dll.sln`, set **x64** and **Release**, and do the: Build -> Build yolo_console_dll\\n\\n    * you can run your console application from Windows Explorer `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\yolo_console_dll.exe`\\n    **use this command**: `yolo_console_dll.exe data/coco.names yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights test.mp4`\\n    \\n    * or you can run from MSVS2015 (before this - you should copy 2 files `yolo-voc.cfg` and `yolo-voc.weights` to the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\` )\\n    * after launching your console application and entering the image file name - you will see info for each object: \\n    `<obj_id> <left_x> <top_y> <width> <height> <probability>`\\n    * to use simple OpenCV-GUI you should uncomment line `//#define OPENCV` in `yolo_console_dll.cpp`-file: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/a6cbaeecde40f91ddc3ea09aa26a03ab5bbf8ba8/src/yolo_console_dll.cpp#L5)\\n    * you can see source code of simple example for detection on the video file: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/ab1c5f9e57b4175f29a6ef39e7e68987d3e98704/src/yolo_console_dll.cpp#L75)\\n   \\n`yolo_cpp_dll.dll`-API: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/src/yolo_v2_class.hpp#L42)\\n```\\nclass Detector {\\npublic:\\n\\tDetector(std::string cfg_filename, std::string weight_filename, int gpu_id = 0);\\n\\t~Detector();\\n\\n\\tstd::vector<bbox_t> detect(std::string image_filename, float thresh = 0.2, bool use_mean = false);\\n\\tstd::vector<bbox_t> detect(image_t img, float thresh = 0.2, bool use_mean = false);\\n\\tstatic image_t load_image(std::string image_filename);\\n\\tstatic void free_image(image_t m);\\n\\n#ifdef OPENCV\\n\\tstd::vector<bbox_t> detect(cv::Mat mat, float thresh = 0.2, bool use_mean = false);\\n#endif\\n};\\n```\\n',\n",

Or you can try to run so `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib test.mp4` How to use this SO-library from your own code - you can look at C++ example: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/src/yolo_console_dll.cpp\\n    or use in such a way: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib data/coco.names cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights test.mp4`\\n* `ZED_CAMERA=1` to build a library with ZED-3D-camera support (should be ZED SDK installed), then run\\n    `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./uselib data/coco.names cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights zed_camera`\\n\\nTo run Darknet on Linux use examples from this article, just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`, i.e. use this command: `./darknet detector test ./cfg/coco.data ./cfg/yolov3.cfg ./yolov3.weights`\\n\\n### How to compile on Windows (using `vcpkg`)\\n\\nIf you have already installed Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019, CUDA > 10.0, cuDNN > 7.0, OpenCV > 2.4, then compile Darknet by using `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\CMake\\\\bin\\\\cmake-gui.exe` as on this [**IMAGE**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4096485/55107892-6becf380-50e3-11e9-9a0a-556a943c429a.png): Configure -> Optional platform for generator (Set: x64) -> Finish -> Generate -> Open Project -> x64 & Release -> Build -> Build solution\\n\\nOtherwise, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Install or update Visual Studio to at least version 2017, making sure to have it fully patched (run again the installer if not sure to automatically update to latest version). If you need to install from scratch, download VS from here: [Visual Studio Community](http://visualstudio.com)\\n\\n2. Install CUDA and cuDNN\\n\\n3. Install `git` and `cmake`. Make sure they are on the Path at least for the current account\\n\\n4. Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) and try to install a test library to make sure everything is working, for example `vcpkg install opengl`\\n\\n5. Define an environment variables, `VCPKG_ROOT`, pointing to the install path of `vcpkg`\\n\\n6. Define another environment variable, with name `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET` and value `x64-windows`\\n\\n7. Open Powershell and type these commands:\\n\\n```PowerShell\\nPS \\\\>                  cd $env:VCPKG_ROOT\\nPS Code\\\\vcpkg>         .\\\\vcpkg install pthreads opencv[ffmpeg] #replace with opencv[cuda,ffmpeg] in case you want to use cuda-accelerated openCV\\n```\\n\\n8.  Open Powershell, go to the `darknet` folder and build with the command `.\\\\build.ps1`. If you want to use Visual Studio, you will find two custom solutions created for you by CMake after the build, one in `build_win_debug` and the other in `build_win_release`, containing all the appropriate config flags for your system.\\n\\n### How to compile on Windows (legacy way)\\n\\n1. If you have **CUDA 10.0, cuDNN 7.4 and OpenCV 3.x** (with paths: `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include` & `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`), then open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet.sln`, set **x64** and **Release** https://hsto.org/webt/uh/fk/-e/uhfk-eb0q-hwd9hsxhrikbokd6u.jpeg and do the: Build -> Build darknet. Also add Windows system variable `CUDNN` with path to CUDNN: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4096485/53249764-019ef880-36ca-11e9-8ffe-d9cf47e7e462.jpg\\n\\n    1.1. Find files `opencv_world320.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg320_64.dll` (or `opencv_world340.dll` and `opencv_ffmpeg340_64.dll`) in `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\bin` and put it near with `darknet.exe`\\n    \\n    1.2 Check that there are `bin` and `include` folders in the `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\\\CUDA\\\\v10.0` if aren\\'t, then copy them to this folder from the path where is CUDA installed\\n    \\n    1.3. To install CUDNN (speedup neural network), do the following:\\n      \\n    * download and install **cuDNN v7.4.1 for CUDA 10.0**: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive\\n      \\n    * add Windows system variable `CUDNN` with path to CUDNN: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4096485/53249764-019ef880-36ca-11e9-8ffe-d9cf47e7e462.jpg\\n    \\n    * copy file `cudnn64_7.dll` to the folder `\\\\build\\\\darknet\\\\x64` near with `darknet.exe`\\n    \\n    1.4. If you want to build **without CUDNN** then: open `\\\\darknet.sln` -> (right click on project) -> properties  -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions, and remove this: `CUDNN;`\\n\\n2. If you have other version of **CUDA (not 10.0)** then open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet.vcxproj` by using Notepad, find 2 places with \"CUDA 10.0\" and change it to your CUDA-version. Then open `\\\\darknet.sln` -> (right click on project) -> properties  -> CUDA C/C++ -> Device and remove there `;compute_75,sm_75`. Then do step 1\\n\\n3. If you **don\\'t have GPU**, but have **OpenCV 3.0** (with paths: `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include` & `C:\\\\opencv_3.0\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`), then open `build\\\\darknet\\\\darknet_no_gpu.sln`, set **x64** and **Release**, and do the: Build -> Build darknet_no_gpu\\n\\n4. If you have **OpenCV 2.4.13** instead of 3.0 then you should change paths after `\\\\darknet.sln` is opened\\n\\n    4.1 (right click on project) -> properties  -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories:  `C:\\\\opencv_2.4.13\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\include`\\n  \\n    4.2 (right click on project) -> properties  -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories: `C:\\\\opencv_2.4.13\\\\opencv\\\\build\\\\x64\\\\vc14\\\\lib`\\n    \\n5.

Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (154 MB): http://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74 and put to the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64`\\n\\n2. Download The Pascal VOC Data and unpack it to directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc` will be created dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc\\\\VOCdevkit\\\\`:\\n    * http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar\\n    * http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\\n    * http://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar\\n    \\n    2.1 Download file `voc_label.py` to dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc`: http://pjreddie.com/media/files/voc_label.py\\n\\n3. Download and install Python for Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-amd64.exe\\n\\n4. Run command: `python build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\voc\\\\voc_label.py` (to generate files: 2007_test.txt, 2007_train.txt, 2007_val.txt, 2012_train.txt, 2012_val.txt)\\n\\n5. Run command: `type 2007_train.txt 2007_val.txt 2012_*.txt > train.txt`\\n\\n6. Set `batch=64` and `subdivisions=8` in the file `yolov3-voc.cfg`: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/ee38c6e1513fb089b35be4ffa692afd9b3f65747/cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg#L3-L4)\\n\\n7. Start training by using `train_voc.cmd` or by using the command line: \\n\\n    `darknet.exe detector train cfg/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg darknet53.conv.74` \\n\\n(**Note:** To disable Loss-Window use flag `-dont_show`.

Train it first on 1 GPU for like 1000 iterations: `darknet.exe detector train cfg/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg darknet53.conv.74`\\n\\n2. Then stop and by using partially-trained model `/backup/yolov3-voc_1000.weights` run training with multigpu (up to 4 GPUs): `darknet.exe detector train cfg/voc.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg /backup/yolov3-voc_1000.weights -gpus 0,1,2,3`\\n\\nOnly for small datasets sometimes better to decrease learning rate, for 4 GPUs set `learning_rate = 0.00025` (i.e. learning_rate = 0.001 / GPUs). In this case also increase 4x times `burn_in =` and `max_batches =` in your cfg-file. I.e. use `burn_in = 4000` instead of `1000`. Same goes for `steps=` if `policy=steps` is set.\\n\\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/darknet/NbJqonJBTSY/Te5PfIpuCAAJ\\n\\n## How to train (to detect your custom objects):\\n(to train old Yolo v2 `yolov2-voc.cfg`, `yolov2-tiny-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.2.0.cfg`, ...

Create file `yolo-obj.cfg` with the same content as in `yolov3.cfg` (or copy `yolov3.cfg` to `yolo-obj.cfg)` and:\\n\\n  * change line batch to [`batch=64`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L3)\\n  * change line subdivisions to [`subdivisions=8`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n  * change line max_batches to (`classes*2000`), f.e. [`max_batches=6000`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L20) if you train for 3 classes\\n  * change line steps to 80% and 90% of max_batches, f.e. [`steps=4800,5400`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L22)\\n  * change line `classes=80` to your number of objects in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers:\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L610\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L696\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L783\\n  * change [`filters=255`] to filters=(classes + 5)x3 in the 3 `[convolutional]` before each `[yolo]` layer\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L603\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L689\\n      * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L776\\n\\n  So if `classes=1` then should be `filters=18`. If `classes=2` then write `filters=21`.\\n  \\n  **(Do not write in the cfg-file: filters=(classes + 5)x3)**\\n  \\n  (Generally `filters` depends on the `classes`, `coords` and number of `mask`s, i.e. filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*<number of mask>`, where `mask` is indices of anchors. If `mask` is absence, then filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*num`)\\n\\n  So for example, for 2 objects, your file `yolo-obj.cfg` should differ from `yolov3.cfg` in such lines in each of **3** [yolo]-layers:\\n\\n  ```\\n  [convolutional]\\n  filters=21\\n\\n  [region]\\n  classes=2\\n  ```\\n\\n2. Create file `obj.names` in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, with objects names - each in new line\\n\\n3. Create file `obj.data` in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, containing (where **classes = number of objects**):\\n\\n  ```\\n  classes= 2\\n  train  = data/train.txt\\n  valid  = data/test.txt\\n  names = data/obj.names\\n  backup = backup/\\n  ```\\n\\n4. Put image-files (.jpg) of your objects in the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\obj\\\\`\\n\\n5. You should label each object on images from your dataset. Use this visual GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\nIt will create `.txt`-file for each `.jpg`-image-file - in the same directory and with the same name, but with `.txt`-extension, and put to file: object number and object coordinates on this image, for each object in new line: \\n\\n`<object-class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`\\n\\n  Where: \\n  * `<object-class>` - integer object number from `0` to `(classes-1)`\\n  * `<x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>` - float values **relative** to width and height of image, it can be equal from `(0.0 to 1.0]`\\n  * for example: `<x> = <absolute_x> / <image_width>` or `<height> = <absolute_height> / <image_height>`\\n  * atention: `<x_center> <y_center>` - are center of rectangle (are not top-left corner)\\n\\n  For example for `img1.jpg` you will be created `img1.txt` containing:\\n\\n  ```\\n  1 0.716797 0.395833 0.216406 0.147222\\n  0 0.687109 0.379167 0.255469 0.158333\\n  1 0.420312 0.395833 0.140625 0.166667\\n  ```\\n\\n6. Create file `train.txt` in directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\`, with filenames of your images, each filename in new line, with path relative to `darknet.exe`, for example containing:\\n\\n  ```\\n  data/obj/img1.jpg\\n  data/obj/img2.jpg\\n  data/obj/img3.jpg\\n  ```\\n\\n7. Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (154 MB): https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74 and put to the directory `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64`\\n\\n8. Start training by using the command line: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74`\\n     \\n   To train on Linux use command: `./darknet detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74` (just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`)\\n     \\n   * (file `yolo-obj_last.weights` will be saved to the `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` for each 100 iterations)\\n   * (file `yolo-obj_xxxx.weights` will be saved to the `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\` for each 1000 iterations)\\n   * (to disable Loss-Window use `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -dont_show`, if you train on computer without monitor like a cloud Amazon EC2)\\n   * (to see the mAP & Loss-chart during training on remote server without GUI, use command `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -dont_show -mjpeg_port 8090 -map` then open URL `http://ip-address:8090` in Chrome/Firefox browser)\\n\\n8.1. For training with mAP (mean average precisions) calculation for each 4 Epochs (set `valid=valid.txt` or `train.txt` in `obj.data` file) and run: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -map`\\n\\n9. After training is complete - get result `yolo-obj_final.weights` from path `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup\\\\`\\n\\n * After each 100 iterations you can stop and later start training from this point. For example, after 2000 iterations you can stop training, and later just start training using: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_2000.weights`\\n\\n    (in the original repository https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet the weights-file is saved only once every 10 000 iterations `if(iterations > 1000)`)\\n\\n * Also you can get result earlier than all 45000 iterations.\\n \\n **Note:** If during training you see `nan` values for `avg` (loss) field - then training goes wrong, but if `nan` is in some other lines - then training goes well.\\n \\n **Note:** If you changed width= or height= in your cfg-file, then new width and height must be divisible by 32.\\n \\n **Note:** After training use such command for detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n \\n  **Note:** if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n \\n### How to train tiny-yolo (to detect your custom objects):\\n\\nDo all the same steps as for the full yolo model as described above. With the exception of:\\n* Download default weights file for yolov3-tiny: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights\\n* Get pre-trained weights `yolov3-tiny.conv.15` using command: `darknet.exe partial cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg yolov3-tiny.weights yolov3-tiny.conv.15 15`\\n* Make your custom model `yolov3-tiny-obj.cfg` based on `cfg/yolov3-tiny_obj.cfg` instead of `yolov3.cfg`\\n* Start training: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolov3-tiny-obj.cfg yolov3-tiny.conv.15`\\n\\nFor training Yolo based on other models ([DenseNet201-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/densenet201_yolo.cfg) or [ResNet50-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/resnet50_yolo.cfg)), you can download and get pre-trained weights as showed in this file: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/partial.cmd\\nIf you made you custom model that isn\\'t based on other models, then you can train it without pre-trained weights, then will be used random initial weights.\\n \\n## When should I stop training:\\n\\nUsually sufficient 2000 iterations for each class(object), but not less than 4000 iterations in total. But for a more precise definition when you should stop training, use the following manual:\\n\\n1. During training, you will see varying indicators of error, and you should stop when no longer decreases **0.XXXXXXX avg**:\\n\\n  > Region Avg IOU: 0.798363, Class: 0.893232, Obj: 0.700808, No Obj: 0.004567, Avg Recall: 1.000000,  count: 8\\n  > Region Avg IOU: 0.800677, Class: 0.892181, Obj: 0.701590, No Obj: 0.004574, Avg Recall: 1.000000,  count: 8\\n  >\\n  > **9002**: 0.211667, **0.060730 avg**, 0.001000 rate, 3.868000 seconds, 576128 images\\n  > Loaded: 0.000000 seconds\\n\\n  * **9002** - iteration number (number of batch)\\n  * **0.060730 avg** - average loss (error) - **the lower, the better**\\n\\n  When you see that average loss **0.xxxxxx avg** no longer decreases at many iterations then you should stop training. The final avgerage loss can be from `0.05` (for a small model and easy dataset) to `3.0` (for a big model and a difficult dataset).\\n\\n2. Once training is stopped, you should take some of last `.weights`-files from `darknet\\\\build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\backup` and choose the best of them:\\n\\nFor example, you stopped training after 9000 iterations, but the best result can give one of previous weights (7000, 8000, 9000). It can happen due to overfitting. **Overfitting** - is case when you can detect objects on images from training-dataset, but can\\'t detect objects on any others images. You should get weights from **Early Stopping Point**:\\n\\n![Overfitting](https://hsto.org/files/5dc/7ae/7fa/5dc7ae7fad9d4e3eb3a484c58bfc1ff5.png) \\n\\nTo get weights from Early Stopping Point:\\n\\n  2.1. At first, in your file `obj.data` you must specify the path to the validation dataset `valid = valid.txt` (format of `valid.txt` as in `train.txt`), and if you haven\\'t validation images, just copy `data\\\\train.txt` to `data\\\\valid.txt`.\\n\\n  2.2 If training is stopped after 9000 iterations, to validate some of previous weights use this commands:\\n\\n(If you use another GitHub repository, then use `darknet.exe detector recall`... instead of `darknet.exe detector map`...)\\n\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_7000.weights`\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n* `darknet.exe detector map data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\\\\yolo-obj_9000.weights`\\n\\nAnd comapre last output lines for each weights (7000, 8000, 9000):\\n\\nChoose weights-file **with the highest mAP (mean average precision)** or IoU (intersect over union)\\n\\nFor example, **bigger mAP** gives weights `yolo-obj_8000.weights` - then **use this weights for detection**.\\n\\nOr just train with `-map` flag: \\n\\n`darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg darknet53.conv.74 -map` \\n\\nSo you will see mAP-chart (red-line) in the Loss-chart Window. mAP will be calculated for each 4 Epochs using `valid=valid.txt` file that is specified in `obj.data` file (`1 Epoch = images_in_train_txt / batch` iterations)\\n\\n(to change the max x-axis value - change [`max_batches=`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L20) parameter to `2000*classes`, f.e. `max_batches=6000` for 3 classes)\\n\\n![loss_chart_map_chart](https://hsto.org/webt/yd/vl/ag/ydvlagutof2zcnjodstgroen8ac.jpeg)\\n\\nExample of custom object detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n\\n* **IoU** (intersect over union) - average instersect over union of objects and detections for a certain threshold = 0.24\\n\\n* **mAP** (mean average precision) - mean value of `average precisions` for each class, where `average precision` is average value of 11 points on PR-curve for each possible threshold (each probability of detection) for the same class (Precision-Recall in terms of PascalVOC, where Precision=TP/(TP+FP) and Recall=TP/(TP+FN) ), page-11: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/postscript/ijcv_voc09.pdf\\n\\n**mAP** is default metric of precision in the PascalVOC competition, **this is the same as AP50** metric in the MS COCO competition.\\nIn terms of Wiki, indicators Precision and Recall have a slightly different meaning than in the PascalVOC competition, but **IoU always has the same meaning**.\\n\\n![precision_recall_iou](https://hsto.org/files/ca8/866/d76/ca8866d76fb840228940dbf442a7f06a.jpg)\\n\\n### How to calculate mAP on PascalVOC 2007:\\n\\n1. To calculate mAP (mean average precision) on PascalVOC-2007-test:\\n* Download PascalVOC dataset, install Python 3.x and get file `2007_test.txt` as described here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-train-pascal-voc-data\\n* Then download file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/scripts/voc_label_difficult.py to the dir `build\\\\darknet\\\\x64\\\\data\\\\` then run `voc_label_difficult.py` to get the file `difficult_2007_test.txt`\\n* Remove symbol `#` from this line to un-comment it: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/data/voc.data#L4\\n* Then there are 2 ways to get mAP:\\n    1. Using Darknet + Python: run the file `build/darknet/x64/calc_mAP_voc_py.cmd` - you will get mAP for `yolo-voc.cfg` model, mAP = 75.9%\\n    2. Using this fork of Darknet: run the file `build/darknet/x64/calc_mAP.cmd` - you will get mAP for `yolo-voc.cfg` model, mAP = 75.8%\\n    \\n (The article specifies the value of mAP = 76.8% for YOLOv2 416Ã\\x97416, page-4 table-3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242v1.pdf. We get values lower - perhaps due to the fact that the model was trained on a slightly different source code than the code on which the detection is was done)\\n\\n* if you want to get mAP for `tiny-yolo-voc.cfg` model, then un-comment line for tiny-yolo-voc.cfg and comment line for yolo-voc.cfg in the .cmd-file\\n* if you have Python 2.x instead of Python 3.x, and if you use Darknet+Python-way to get mAP, then in your cmd-file use `reval_voc.py` and `voc_eval.py` instead of `reval_voc_py3.py` and `voc_eval_py3.py` from this directory: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/master/scripts\\n\\n### Custom object detection:\\n\\nExample of custom object detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`\\n\\n| ![Yolo_v2_training](https://hsto.org/files/d12/1e7/515/d121e7515f6a4eb694913f10de5f2b61.jpg) | ![Yolo_v2_training](https://hsto.org/files/727/c7e/5e9/727c7e5e99bf4d4aa34027bb6a5e4bab.jpg) |\\n|---|---|\\n\\n## How to improve object detection:\\n\\n1. Before training:\\n  * set flag `random=1` in your `.cfg`-file - it will increase precision by training Yolo for different resolutions: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L788)\\n\\n  * increase network resolution in your `.cfg`-file (`height=608`, `width=608` or any value multiple of 32) - it will increase precision\\n\\n\\n  * check that each object that you want to detect is mandatory labeled in your dataset - no one object in your data set should not be without label. In the most training issues - there are wrong labels in your dataset (got labels by using some conversion script, marked with a third-party tool, ...). Always check your dataset by using: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\n  * for each object which you want to detect - there must be at least 1 similar object in the Training dataset with about the same: shape, side of object, relative size, angle of rotation, tilt, illumination. So desirable that your training dataset include images with objects at diffrent: scales, rotations, lightings, from different sides, on different backgrounds - you should preferably have 2000 different images for each class or more, and you should train `2000*classes` iterations or more\\n\\n  * desirable that your training dataset include images with non-labeled objects that you do not want to detect - negative samples without bounded box (empty `.txt` files) - use as many images of negative samples as there are images with objects\\n\\n  * for training with a large number of objects in each image, add the parameter `max=200` or higher value in the last `[yolo]`-layer or `[region]`-layer in your cfg-file (the global maximum number of objects that can be detected by YoloV3 is `0,0615234375*(width*height)` where are width and height are parameters from `[net]` section in cfg-file) \\n  \\n  * for training for small objects (smaller than 16x16 after the image is resized to 416x416) - set `layers = -1, 11` instead of https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6390a5a2ab61a0bdf6f1a9a6b4a739c16b36e0d7/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L720\\n      and set `stride=4` instead of https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6390a5a2ab61a0bdf6f1a9a6b4a739c16b36e0d7/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L717\\n  \\n  * for training for both small and large objects use modified models:\\n      * Full-model: 5 yolo layers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3_5l.cfg\\n      * Tiny-model: 3 yolo layers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3-tiny_3l.cfg\\n      * Spatial-full-model: 3 yolo layers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\\n  \\n  * If you train the model to distinguish Left and Right objects as separate classes (left/right hand, left/right-turn on road signs, ...) then for disabling flip data augmentation - add `flip=0` here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/3d2d0a7c98dbc8923d9ff705b81ff4f7940ea6ff/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L17\\n  \\n  * General rule - your training dataset should include such a set of relative sizes of objects that you want to detect: \\n\\n    * `train_network_width * train_obj_width / train_image_width ~= detection_network_width * detection_obj_width / detection_image_width`\\n    * `train_network_height * train_obj_height / train_image_height ~= detection_network_height * detection_obj_height / detection_image_height`\\n    \\n    I.e. for each object from Test dataset there must be at least 1 object in the Training dataset with the same class_id and about the same relative size:\\n\\n    `object width in percent from Training dataset` ~= `object width in percent from Test dataset` \\n   \\n    That is, if only objects that occupied 80-90% of the image were present in the training set, then the trained network will not be able to detect objects that occupy 1-10% of the image.\\n    \\n  * to speedup training (with decreasing detection accuracy) do Fine-Tuning instead of Transfer-Learning, set param `stopbackward=1` here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/6d44529cf93211c319813c90e0c1adb34426abe5/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L548\\n    then do this command: `./darknet partial cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights yolov3.conv.81 81` will be created file `yolov3.conv.81`,\\n    then train by using weights file `yolov3.conv.81` instead of `darknet53.conv.74`\\n\\n  * each: `model of object, side, illimination, scale, each 30 grad` of the turn and inclination angles - these are *different objects* from an internal perspective of the neural network. So the more *different objects* you want to detect, the more complex network model should be used.\\n\\n  * recalculate anchors for your dataset for `width` and `height` from cfg-file:\\n  `darknet.exe detector calc_anchors data/obj.data -num_of_clusters 9 -width 416 -height 416`\\n   then set the same 9 `anchors` in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers in your cfg-file. But you should change indexes of anchors `masks=` for each [yolo]-layer, so that 1st-[yolo]-layer has anchors larger than 60x60, 2nd larger than 30x30, 3rd remaining. Also you should change the `filters=(classes + 5)*<number of mask>` before each [yolo]-layer. If many of the calculated anchors do not fit under the appropriate layers - then just try using all the default anchors.\\n\\n\\n2. After training - for detection:\\n\\n  * Increase network-resolution by set in your `.cfg`-file (`height=608` and `width=608`) or (`height=832` and `width=832`) or (any value multiple of 32) - this increases the precision and makes it possible to detect small objects: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L8-L9)\\n  \\n    * it is not necessary to train the network again, just use `.weights`-file already trained for 416x416 resolution\\n    * but to get even greater accuracy you should train with higher resolution 608x608 or 832x832, note: if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)\\n\\n## How to mark bounded boxes of objects and create annotation files:\\n\\nHere you can find repository with GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark\\n\\nWith example of: `train.txt`, `obj.names`, `obj.data`, `yolo-obj.cfg`, `air`1-6`.txt`, `bird`1-4`.txt` for 2 classes of objects (air, bird) and `train_obj.cmd` with example how to train this image-set with Yolo v2 & v3\\n\\n## Using Yolo9000\\n\\n Simultaneous detection and classification of 9000 objects: `darknet.exe detector test cfg/combine9k.data cfg/yolo9000.cfg yolo9000.weights data/dog.jpg`\\n\\n* `yolo9000.weights` - (186 MB Yolo9000 Model) requires 4 GB GPU-RAM: http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo9000.weights\\n\\n* `yolo9000.cfg` - cfg-file of the Yolo9000, also there are paths to the `9k.tree` and `coco9k.map`  https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/617cf313ccb1fe005db3f7d88dec04a04bd97cc2/cfg/yolo9000.cfg#L217-L218\\n\\n    * `9k.tree` - **WordTree** of 9418 categories  - `<label> <parent_it>`, if `parent_id == -1` then this label hasn\\'t parent: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.tree\\n\\n    * `coco9k.map` - map 80 categories from MSCOCO to WordTree `9k.tree`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/coco9k.map\\n\\n* `combine9k.data` - data file, there are paths to: `9k.labels`, `9k.names`, `inet9k.map`, (change path to your `combine9k.train.list`): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/combine9k.data\\n\\n    * `9k.labels` - 9418 labels of objects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.labels\\n\\n    * `9k.names` -\\n9418 names of objects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/9k.names\\n\\n    * `inet9k.map` - map 200 categories from ImageNet to WordTree `9k.tree`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/build/darknet/x64/data/inet9k.map\\n\\n\\n## How to use Yolo as DLL and SO libraries\\n\\n* on Linux - set `LIBSO=1` in the `Makefile` and do `make`\\n* on Windows - compile `build\\\\darknet\\\\yolo_cpp_dll.sln` or `build\\\\darknet\\\\yolo_cpp_dll_no_gpu.sln` solution\\n\\nThere are 2 APIs:\\n* C API: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/include/darknet.h\\n    * Python examples using the C API::     \\n         * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/darknet.py\\t\\n         * https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/darknet_video.py\\n    \\n* C++ API: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/include/yolo_v2_class.hpp\\n    * C++ example that uses C++ API: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/src/yolo_console_dll.cpp\\n    \\n----\\n\\n1.
