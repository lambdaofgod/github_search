Off The Hook is an extension that visually inspects web sites as a human would do and recognizes when pages look like valid sites.

People don't have time to pay attention to every url they click. This is especially true when faced with deadlines.

Off The Hook is an extension that visually inspects web sites as a human would do and recognizes when pages look like valid sites.
